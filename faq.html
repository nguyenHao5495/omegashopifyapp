                        <p class="question"><b>Does the app need additional source code? </b></p>
                    </li>
                    <p class="answer">No, The app is used right away </p>
                    <li>
                        <p class="question"><b>How does the trial system work?</b></p>
                    </li>
                    <p class="answer">When you install our app for the first time, you can use it free of charge of a period of time (the trial
                        period). The
                        trial period
                        only
                        available once for each store. If the trial period were available every time the app is installed, a store could uninstall and
                        reinstall the
                        app many times to use the app for free forever.</p>
                    <p class="answer">Our Related Products By Tag app has a trial period of 7 days. You can re-install the app as many times as you
                        want within
                        those 7
                        days and
                        you will not be charged.</p>
                    <p class="answer">If you don't want to be charged when the trial period expires, you have to uninstall the app before that date.
                        But if you
                        uninstall
                        the app
                        and install it again after the trial period, you will be charged immediately.</p>
                    <li>
                        <p class="question"><b>Can my store get a trial extension?</b></p>
                    </li>
                    <p class="answer">We use the standard Shopify trial system that is not prepared to deal with trial extensions and we consider that
                        our trial
                        period
                        gives
                        stores enough time to test the app capabilities and see if the app is a good fit for their store. So we are sorry to say that
                        there's
                        no
                        easy way to extend your trial.</p>

                    </li>
                    <p class="answer">You can use Latin, Vietnamese. Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew, and other languages, if you have any problem in using
                        your
                        language with
                        our
                        app,
                        please contact us and we will check it as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p class="answer">We support all kind of currency in the world so you can use any kind you want to.</p>
